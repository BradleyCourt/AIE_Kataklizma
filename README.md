*They did the Monster Smash, wa-ooo...*

## Technical Design

* Unity Meshes should be in a child node under the object node.

### Character
* Melee, Ranged and AoE attacks (with cooldown, duration, damage variables)
* Move (oriented with camera)
* Dash (oriented with camera) *(Suggest: half-second charge-up time to allow player to cancel by moving character or re-align by moving camera)
* Jump

### Camera
* Third-person, rotates around player character (camera "Target")

### Levelling



### Tank
* Navmesh patrols
* Turret and Barrel rotates and elevates to tank target
* Machine-gun and Cannon attacks
